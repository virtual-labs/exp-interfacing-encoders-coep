## Aim 
- To interface an incremental encoder with an Arduino Uno to measure the rotational speed (RPM) of a DC motor. 

## Objective
-  Understand the working of an incremental rotary encoder
-  Interface the encoder with Arduino UNO using digital input pins
-	Write Arduino code to track the direction and number of steps
-	Apply the encoder in real-time position monitoring tasks
