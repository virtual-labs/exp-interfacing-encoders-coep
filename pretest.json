      "question": "Why is the 12V DC motor connected to a separate 12V power supply instead of the Arduino's 5V pin?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The motor's voltage and current requirements are higher than what the Arduino can provide.",
        "b": "The motor will run faster on a separate power supply.",
        "c": "The separate power supply is used for safety purposes.",
        "d": "The motor will damage the Arduino if connected to its 5V pin."
