      "question": "How does the potentiometer affect the encoderâ€™s output?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It directly changes the PPR value.",
        "b": "It controls the motor's speed, which in turn changes the rate at which the encoder generates pulses.",
        "c": "It provides a constant voltage to the encoder, regardless of the motor's speed.",
        "d": "It has no effect on the encoder."

    {
      "question": "What would happen if the volatile keyword was removed from the count variable?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The code would not compile.",
        "b": "The RPM reading would be inaccurate or erratic, especially at high speeds, as the compiler might optimize the variable incorrectly.",
        "c": "The motor would not turn on.",
        "d": "The LCD would stop displaying text."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the attachInterrupt() function in the setup()?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It starts the main loop of the program.",
        "b": "It connects the LCD to the Arduino.",
        "c": "It assigns a function to be executed automatically when a specific event occurs on a designated pin.",
        "d": "It resets the Arduino to its default settings."

    {
      "question": "If you used an absolute encoder in this project, what would be the primary difference in the code's logic?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The code would need a more complex calculation to determine the exact position of the shaft, not just the change in position.",
        "b": "The attachInterrupt() function would not be needed.",
        "c": "The loop() function would be replaced with a different function.",
        "d": "The LCD would no longer be necessary."

    {
      "question": "The interval variable is set to 1000ms. What is the primary benefit of using this value compared to a smaller value like 200ms?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It makes the code simpler to write.",
        "b": "It provides more stable and accurate RPM readings, as it averages the pulses over a longer period.",
        "c": "It allows the motor to run faster.",
        "d": "It reduces the power consumption of the circuit."
