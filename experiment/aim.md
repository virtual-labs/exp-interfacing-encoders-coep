## Aim 
- To interface an incremental encoder with an Arduino Uno to measure the speed (RPM)of a DC motor .

## Objective
-  Understand the working of an incremental rotary encoder
-  Interface the encoder with Arduino UNO using digital input pins
-  Learn to use an interrupt-driven approach in Arduino to count encoder pulses
	accurately and efficiently.
-  Program the Arduino to measure the encoder pulses to display the motor RPM
	based on counted pulses.
